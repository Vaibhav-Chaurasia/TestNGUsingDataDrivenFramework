What are TestNG Annotations?
TestNG Annotations are used to control the next method to be executed in the test script. TestNG annotations are defined before every method in the test code. In case any method is not prefixed with annotations, it will be ignored and not be executed as part of the test code. To define them, methods need to be simply annotated with ‘@Test‘.


TestNG Annotations
@BeforeSuite: The annotated method will be run before all tests in this suite have run.

@AfterSuite: The annotated method will be run after all tests in this suite have run.

@BeforeTest: The annotated method will be run before any test method belonging to the classes inside the tag is run.

@AfterTest: The annotated method will be run after all the test methods belonging to the classes inside the tag have run.

@BeforeGroups: The list of groups that this configuration method will run before. This method is guaranteed to run shortly before the first test method that belongs to any of these groups is invoked.

@AfterGroups: The list of groups that this configuration method will run after. This method is guaranteed to run shortly after the last test method that belongs to any of these groups is invoked.

@BeforeClass: The annotated method will be run before the first test method in the current class is invoked.

@AfterClass: The annotated method will be run after all the test methods in the current class have been run.

@BeforeMethod: The annotated method will be run before each test method.

@AfterMethod: The annotated method will be run after each test method.

@Test: The annotated method is a part of a test case

Benefits of using TestNG Annotations:
- TestNG Annotations made the life of testers very easy. Based on your requirements, you can access the test methods, i.e., it has no predefined pattern or format.
- You can pass the additional parameters to TestNG annotations.
- In the case of TestNG annotations, you do not need to extend any test classes.
- TestNG Annotations are strongly typed, i.e., errors are detected at the compile time.


To Implement Annotations, add dependencies in POM file -

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.testng</groupId>
			<artifactId>testng</artifactId>
			<version>6.14.3</version>
			<scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>
