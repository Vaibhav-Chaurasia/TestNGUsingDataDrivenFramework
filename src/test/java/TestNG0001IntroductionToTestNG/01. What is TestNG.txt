What is TestNG?
TestNG is an automation testing framework in which NG stands for "Next Generation". TestNG is inspired by JUnit which uses the annotations (@). TestNG overcomes the disadvantages of JUnit and is designed to make end-to-end testing easy.

Using TestNG, you can generate a proper report, and you can easily come to know how many test cases are passed, failed, and skipped. You can execute the failed test cases separately.

For example:

Suppose, you have five test cases, one method is written for each test case (Assume that the program is written using the main method without using testNG). When you run this program first, three methods are executed successfully, and the fourth method is failed. Then correct the errors present in the fourth method, now you want to run only fourth method because first three methods are anyway executed successfully. This is not possible without using TestNG.

The TestNG in Selenium provides an option, i.e., testng-failed.xml file in test-output folder. If you want to run only failed test cases means you run this XML file. It will execute only failed test cases.

Beside above concept, you will learn more on TestNG, like what are the Advantages of TestNG, how to create test methods using @test annotations, how to convert these classes into testing suite file and execute through the eclipse as well as from the command line.

TestNG is one of the most widely used open source testing framework used in automation testing suite.


- TestNG provides you full control over the test cases and the execution of the test cases. Due to this reason, TestNG is also known as a testing framework.
- Cedric Beust is the developer of a TestNG framework.
- If you want to run a test case A before that as a pre-request you need to run multiple test cases before you begin a test case A. You can set and map with the help of TestNG so that pre-request test cases run first and then only it will trigger a test case A. In such way, you can control the test cases.
- TestNG framework came after Junit, and TestNG framework adds more powerful functionality and easier to use.
- TestNG framework eliminates the limitations of the older framework by providing more powerful and flexible test cases with help of easy annotations, grouping, sequencing and parametrizing.
