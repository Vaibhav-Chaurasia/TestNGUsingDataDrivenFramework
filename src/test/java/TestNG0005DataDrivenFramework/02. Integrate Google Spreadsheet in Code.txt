1. Create the spreadsheet using your google account.
2. Make the sheet accessible, not restricted.
3. Insert some data into the sheet.


Now, in the code ->
1. Go to src/main/java folder -> Create a package named as 'Util' or whatever names suited. -> Add one java file in your project named as 'SpreadsheetReader.java'
You can take it from src/main/java folder
2. Now, open the sheet and search for SPREADSHEET_ID
3. Replace this spreadsheet ID from yours.
	- To extract spreadsheet ID of your sheet -> Open Spreadsheet
	- Go to the URL of spreadsheet which looks like - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SBXxbgIYg8dC9cj3WuMB3IjCY15lp-SZMVtyKFQArN/edit#gid=697256699
	- From this URL spreadsheet id is - 1SBXxbgIYg8dC9cj3WuMB3IjCY15lp-SZMVtyKFQArN
4. To resolve the errors, add maven depedencies of spreadsheet in pom.xml file.
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.google.api-client</groupId>

5. Now, add one json file which is named as client_secret.json in your root folder of the project.
It is already added in the root folder.
